  "description" : "Heat map of RNA-seq expression data for your list.  HumanMine includes a number of RNA-seq expression\\ndata sets from different sources. All show expression across different human tissues.  Toggle between\\nthe data sets using the buttons above the heat map.  You can select data from GTex, Protein Atlas or\\nthe Illumina Body Map.  Scroll right to see the full set of tissues for each gene.  Expression values\\ncan be viewed as linear or log and are binned into three expression levels, low, medium and high.\\nNote that the values between the data sets are not directly comparable.  The Gtex and Protein Atlas\\nvalues are TPM (transcripts per million) and the Illumina Body Map are FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase\\nof transcript per Million mapped reads).",
